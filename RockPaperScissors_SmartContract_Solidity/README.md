# Rock Paper Scissors

## Aim of this work:

- Rock, paper and scissors is easy to play in real life, but can it be played via the internet when players cannot watch each other in real time? 
During the period of the course, we have studied the commit reveal paradigm. 
We will be using the same to build the game as a smart contract. 
The aim for this task is to create a Rock Paper Scissors contract in solidity and deploy it on an ethereum testnet.

- Both players must commit to their choice (by making a fist), and then both players must reveal their choice (by opening their fist). 
I will built in a way that guarantees the fair exchange of the answers and allows the winner to collect their winnings.
